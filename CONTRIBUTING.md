# Contributing

We welcome contributions to our codebase and documentation. 

Before you create a PR on the farming module, make sure that you read and comply with this document. See the [open issues](https://github.com/cosmosquad-labs/squad/issues) that we need help with. 

Feel free to inform us if you are willing to work on an issue. Note that the `main` branch contains the latest development version. 

We follow standard GitHub best practices: 

- Fork the repository
- Make sure your `branch` is from the tip of `main` branch
- Make your commits to resolve an issue
- Submit a pull request to `main`

General guidance:

- Make sure you run tests by running `make test-all` locally to see there is any issue
- Review all the checks on your PR and review the code coverage report
