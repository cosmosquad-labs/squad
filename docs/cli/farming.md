# Farming Module

## Synopsis

This document provides a high-level overview of how the command line (CLI) interface works for the `farming` module. To set up a local testing environment, it requires the latest [Starport](https://starport.com/). If you don't have Starport set up in your local machine, see [this Starport guide](https://docs.starport.network/) to install it. Run this command under the project root directory `$ starport chain serve -c config-test.yml`.

Note that [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is recommended to be installed as it is used to process JSON throughout the document.

## CreateFixedAmountPlan

Anyone can create a private plan by paying a fee. A fixed amount plan plans to distribute amount of coins by a fixed amount defined in `EpochAmount`. Internally, `PrivatePlanFarmingPoolAddress` is generated and assigned to the plan. The creator queries the plan and sends amount of coins to the farming pool address so that the plan distributes as intended. To prevent spamming attacks, a `PlanCreationFee` fee must be paid on plan creation.

Create a `private-fixed-plan.json` file. This private fixed amount farming plan intends to provide 100ATOM per epoch (measured in day), relative to the rate amount of denoms that is defined in staking coin weights.

Usage

```bash
create-private-fixed-plan [plan-file]
```

- `name`: the name of the farming plan can be any name to store in a blockchain network, duplicate values are allowed
- `staking_coin_weights`: the distributing amount for each epoch. An amount must be decimal, not an integer. The sum of total weight must be 1.000000000000000000
- `start_time`: start time of the farming plan 
- `end_time`: end time of the farming plan
- `epoch_amount`: the amount to distribute per epoch as an incentive for staking denoms that are defined in the staking coin weights

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "This plan intends to provide incentives for liquidity pool investors and ATOM holders",
  "staking_coin_weights": [
    {
      "denom": "pool1",
      "amount": "0.800000000000000000"
    },
    {
      "denom": "uatom",
      "amount": "0.200000000000000000"
    }
  ],
  "start_time": "2021-08-06T09:00:00Z",
  "end_time": "2021-08-13T09:00:00Z",
  "epoch_amount": [
    {
      "denom": "uatom",
      "amount": "100000000"
    }
  ]
}
```

Example

```bash
# Create a private fixed amount plan
squad tx farming create-private-fixed-plan private-fixed-plan.json \
--chain-id localnet \
--from user1 \
--keyring-backend test \
--broadcast-mode block \
--yes \
--output json | jq
```

## CreateRatioPlan

***This message is disabled by default, you have to build the binary with `make install-testing` to activate this message.***

Anyone can create this private plan type message. A ratio plan plans to distribute amount of coins by ratio that is defined in `EpochRatio`. Internally, `PrivatePlanFarmingPoolAddress` is generated and assigned to the plan. The creator must query the plan and send amount of coins to the farming pool address so that the plan distributes as intended. For a ratio plan, whichever coins that the farming pool address has in balances are used every epoch. To prevent spamming attacks, a `PlanCreationFee` fee must be paid on plan creation.

Create the `private-ratio-plan.json` file. This private ratio farming plan intends to provide ratio of all coins that farming pool address has per epoch (measured in day). In this example, epoch ratio is 10 percent and 10 percent of all the coins that the creator of this plan has in balances are used as incentives for the denoms that are defined in the staking coin weights.

Usage

```bash
create-private-ratio-plan [plan-file]
```

- `name`: the name of the farming plan can be any name to store in a blockchain network, duplicate values are allowed
- `staking_coin_weights`: the distributing amount for each epoch. An amount must be decimal, not an integer. The sum of total weight must be 1.000000000000000000
- `start_time`: start time of the farming plan 
- `end_time`: end time of the farming plan
- `epoch_ratio`: a ratio to distribute per epoch as an incentive for staking denoms that are defined in staking coin weights. The ratio refers to all coins that the creator has in their account. Note that the total ratio cannot exceed 1.0 (100%). 

Example JSON

```json
{
  "name": "This plan intends to provide incentives for Cosmonauts!",
  "staking_coin_weights": [
    {
      "denom": "pool1",
      "amount": "0.800000000000000000"
    },
    {
      "denom": "uatom",
      "amount": "0.200000000000000000"
    }
  ],
  "start_time": "2021-08-06T09:00:00Z",
  "end_time": "2021-08-13T09:00:00Z",
  "epoch_ratio": "0.100000000000000000"
}
```
