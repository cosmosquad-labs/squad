# Messages

Messages (Msg) are objects that trigger state transitions. Msgs are wrapped in transactions (Txs) that clients submit to the network. 
The Cosmos SDK wraps and unwraps `liquidfarming` module messages from transactions.

## MsgFarm

Farm coin to liquid farm. Farming coins are the pool coin that starts with pool prefix, which is a pool coin of a corresponding pool. 
It is important to note that a farmer is not receiving a synthetic version of the farming coins right away. 
It are expected to receive the synthetic version of the farming coins after one epoch at the current mint rate. 
A synthetic version of the farming coin is called as LFCoin in the module and the terminology is used throughout the documentation and codebase. 

```go
type MsgFarm struct {
	PoolId      uint64   // target pool id
	Farmer      string   // the bech32-encoded address that farms coin
	FarmingCoin sdk.Coin // farming amount of pool coin
}
```

Validity checks are performed for `MsgFarm` message. The transaction that is triggered with the `MsgFarm` message fails if:

- The target liquid farm with the pool id does not exist
- The amount of farming coin is not positive
- The amount of farming coin is less than `MinimumFarmAmount`
- The farming coin denom is not the same as the pool coin denom of the pool with `PoolId`
- The farmer has insufficient spendable balances for the farming coin amount

## MsgCancelQueuedFarming

Cancel the farming coins before being staked. 
A farmer is allowed to cancel their farming coin amount before they are staked to the farming module.

```go
type MsgCancelQueuedFarming struct {
	PoolId        uint64   // target pool id
	Farmer        string   // the bech32-encoded address that cancels queued farming
	UnfarmingCoin sdk.Coin // cancel amount of pool coin
}
```

Validity checks are performed for `MsgCancelQueuedFarming` message. The transaction that is triggered with the `MsgCancelQueuedFarming` message fails if:

- The target liquid farm with the pool id does not exist
- The unfarming coin denom is not the same as the pool coin denom of the pool with `PoolId`
- The unfarming coin amount is less than the amount of the queued amount of farming coin of the farmer.

## MsgUnfarm

Unfarm LFCoin to liquid unfarm. 
The module burns LFCoin amounts and releases the corresponding amount of pool coins to a farmer at the current burn rate.

```go
type MsgUnfarm struct {
	PoolId uint64   // target deposit request id
	Farmer string   // the bech32-encoded address that unfarms liquid farm coin
	LFCoin sdk.Coin // withdrawing amount of LF coin
}
```

Validity checks are performed for `MsgUnfarm` message. The transaction that is triggered with the `MsgUnfarm` message fails if:

- The target liquid farm with the pool id does not exist
- The amount of LF coins is not positive
- The unfarming coin denom is not the same as the pool coin denom of the pool with `PoolId`
- The farmer has insufficient spendable balances for the unfarming amount

## MsgUnfarmAndWithdraw

Unfarm LFCoin to liquid unfarm and withdraw the pool coin from the pool. 
The module burns LFCoin amounts at the current burn rate, withdraw the corresponding amount of pool coins from the pool, and then releases the withdrawn coins to a farmer.

```go
type MsgUnfarmAndWithdraw struct {
	PoolId uint64   // target pool id
	Farmer string   // the bech32-encoded address that unfarms liquid farm coin and withdraws
	LFCoin sdk.Coin // withdrawing amount of LF coin
}
```

Validity checks are performed for `MsgUnfarmAndWithdraw` message. The transaction that is triggered with the `MsgUnfarmAndWithdraw` message fails if:

- The target liquid farm with the pool id does not exist
- The amount of LF coins is not positive
- The unfarming coin denom is not the same as the pool coin denom of the pool with `PoolId`
- The farmer has insufficient spendable balances for the unfarming amount

## MsgPlaceBid

Place a bid for a rewards auction. 
Anyone can place a bid for an auction where the bidder placing with the highest bid amount takes all the rewards. 

```go
type MsgPlaceBid struct {
	PoolId      uint64   // target pool id
	Bidder      string   // the bech32-encoded address that places a bid
	BiddingCoin sdk.Coin // bidding amount of pool coin
}
```

Validity checks are performed for `MsgPlaceBid` message. The transaction that is triggered with the `MsgPlaceBid` message fails if:

- The target liquid farm with the pool id does not exist
- The target auction status is in invalid status

## MsgRefundBid

Refund the bid that is not winning for the auction.

```go
type MsgRefundBid struct {
	BidId  uint64 // target bid id
	Bidder string // the bech32-encoded address that refunds a bid
}
```

Validity checks are performed for `MsgRefundBid` message. The transaction that is triggered with the `MsgRefundBid` message fails if:

- The target liquid farm with the pool id does not exist
- The target auction status is in invalid status
- The bid by the bidder in the auction of the liquid farm with the pool id does not exist
