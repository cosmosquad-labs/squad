## Market Maker

Market makers provide liquidity to the exchange by placing orders which are not executed immediately. These orders make it easy for traders to instantly buy or sell when the condition is met.

Market maker intent transaction is followed by 1,000 CRE deposit for spam prevention. New market maker inclusion is decided through governance proposal. Existing market makers who fail to maintain uptime requirement can be excluded by governance.

## Spread

The spread measures the transaction cost how much an investor loses resulting from opening and closing a position. Spread(or Bid-ask spread) is price difference between lowest ask and highest bid in a market and divide by mid-price(average price of bid and ask). Spread larger than MaxSpread for given market will not be recognized.

## Quantity(Depth)

Simple explanation for market depth is how much of the asset can be bought without causing slippage in price. If market depth is not enough to handle large amount of trade, market liquidity is insufficient despite its narrow spread. Quantity is measured from total amount of base coin denominated with quote coin. To appreciate 2-sided liquidity, quantity is calculated both bid and ask side and take the smaller of them. Quantity smaller than MinDepth for given market will not be recognized.

## Uptime

Uptime measure the availability of the liquidity. Especially in market turmoil, availability of liquidity is critical for market participants so that uptime is the most important factors in assessing the performance of market makers. Uptime is calculated as percentage of time a market maker is alive and quoting both bid and ask orders. Those orders should meet certain criteria to be recognized as valid orders.
