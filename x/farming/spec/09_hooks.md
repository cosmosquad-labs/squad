# Hooks

Other modules may register operations to execute when a certain event has occurred within farming. 
These events can be registered to execute right `Before` or `After` the farming event (as per the hook name). 
The following hooks can be registered:

```go
AfterAllocateRewards(ctx sdk.Context)
```
