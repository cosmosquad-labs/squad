# Messages

Messages (Msg) are objects that trigger state transitions. Msgs are wrapped in transactions (Txs) that clients submit to the network. The Cosmos SDK wraps and unwraps `liquidity` module messages from transactions.


## MsgCreatePair
```go
type MsgCreatePair struct {
    Creator        string // the bech32-encoded address of the pair creator
    BaseCoinDenom  string // the base coin denom of the pair
    QuoteCoinDenom string // the quote coin denom of the pair
}
```

## MsgCreatePool
```go
type MsgCreatePool struct {
    Creator      string    // the bech32-encoded address of the pool creator
    PairId       uint64    // the pair id; pool(s) belong to a single pair
    DepositCoins sdk.Coins // the amount of coins to deposit
}
```

## MsgDeposit
```go
type MsgDeposit struct {
    Depositor    string    // the bech32-encoded address that makes a deposit to the pool
    PoolId       uint64    // the pool id
    DepositCoins sdk.Coins // the amount of coins to deposit
}
```

## MsgWithdraw
```go
type MsgWithdraw struct {
    Withdrawer string   // the bech32-encoded address that withdraws pool coin from the pool
    PoolId     uint64   // the pool id
    PoolCoin   sdk.Coin // the amount of pool coin
}
```

## MsgLimitOrder
```go
type MsgLimitOrderBatch struct {
    Orderer         string        // the bech32-encoded address that makes an order
    PairId          uint64        // the pair id
    Direction       SwapDirection // the swap direction; buy or sell
    OfferCoin       sdk.Coin      // the amount of coin that the orderer offers
    DemandCoinDenom string        // the demand coin denom that the orderer wants to swap for
    Price           sdk.Dec       // the order price; the exchange ratio is the amount of quote coin over the amount of base coin
    Amount          sdk.Int       // the amount of base coin that the orderer wants to buy or sell
    OrderLifespan   time.Duration // the order lifespan
}
```

## MsgMarketOrder
```go
type MsgLimitOrderBatch struct {
    Orderer         string        // the bech32-encoded address that makes an order

    Direction       SwapDirection // the swap direction; buy or sell
    OfferCoin       sdk.Coin      // the amount of coin that the orderer offers
    DemandCoinDenom string        // the demand coin denom that the orderer wants to swap for
    Amount          sdk.Int       // the amount of base coin that the orderer wants to buy or sell
    OrderLifespan   time.Duration // the order lifespan
}
```

## MsgCancelOrder
```go
type MsgCancelOrder struct {
    Orderer       string  // the bech32-encoded address that makes an order
    PairId        uint64  // the pair id
    SwapRequestId uint64  // the swap request id
}
```

## MsgCancelAllOrders
```go
type MsgCancelAllOrders struct {
	Orderer string   // the bech32-encoded address that makes an order
	PairIds []uint64 // the pair ids
}
