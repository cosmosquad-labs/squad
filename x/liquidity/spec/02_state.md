# State

The `liquidity` module keeps track of the Pair, Pool, Requests states. 

## Pair

Pair stores information about the coin pair in the liquidity module.
A pair is the dyadic quotation of the relative value of a base coin unit against the unit of quote coin. 

Pair type has the following structure.
```go
type Pair struct {
    Id                  uint64  // index of the coin pair
    BaseCoinDenom       string  // denom of the base coin for the pair
    QuoteCoinDenom      string  // denom of the quote coin for the pair
    EscrowAddress       string  // address for the escrow account 
    LastSwapRequestId   uint64  // index of the last swap request for the pair
    LastPrice           sdk.Dec // the last swap price of the pair
    CurrentBatchId      uint64  // index of the batch for pair. This index increase when valid swaps occur for the pair
}
```

## Pool

Pool stores information about the liquidity pool. 

Pool type has the following structure.
```go
type Pool struct {
    Id                    uint64  // index of the liquidity pool
    PairId                uint64  // index of the coin pair constituting this pool
    ReserveAddress        string  // reserve account address for the liquidity pool to store reserve coins
    PoolCoinDenom         string  // denom of the pool coin
    LastDepositRequestId  uint64  // index of the last deposit request for the pool
    LastWithdrawRequestId uint64  // index of the last withdraw request for the pool
    Disabled              bool    // ture if pool is disabled, false if not disabled
}
```

# Request
Deposit, withdrawal, or swap orders are accumulated for a pre-defined period, which can be one or more blocks in length. 
Orders are then added to the pair or pool and executed at the end of the batch. The following requests are executed in batch-style.

## RequestStatus
```go
type RequestStatus int32

const (
    RequestStatusUnspecified RequestStatus = iota + 1
    RequestStatusNotExecuted
    RequestStatusSucceeded
    RequestStatusFailed
)
```

## DepositRequest
`DeposiRequest` defines the state of deposit message as it is processed in the next batch or batches.

When a user sends `MsgDeposit` transaction to the network, it is accumulated in a batch.
`DeposiRequest` contains the information required for deposit transaction, the result and the status of the request.

```go
type DepositRequest struct {
    Id              uint64      // index of the deposit message in the liquidity pool
    PoolId          uint64      // index of the pool where the deposit will occur
    MsgHeight       int64       // block height where this message is appended to the batch
    Depositor       string      // address that makes a deposit to the pool
    DepositCoins    sdk.Coins   // the amount of coins to deposit
    AcceptedCoins   sdk.Coins   // the amount of accepted coins to deposit
    MintedPoolCoin  sdk.Coin    // the amount of minted pool coin for the amount of accepted coins
    Status          RequestStatus
}
```

## WithdrawRequest
`WithdrawRequest` defines the state of withdraw message as it is processed in the next batch or batches.

When a user sends `MsgWithdraw` transaction to the network, it is accumulated in a batch.
`WithdrawRequest` contains the information required for withdraw transaction, the result and the status of the request.

```go
type WithdrawRequest struct {
    Id              uint64      // index of the withdraw message in the liquidity pool
    PoolId          uint64      // index of the pool where the withdraw will occur
    MsgHeight       int64       // block height where this message is appended to the batch
    Withdrawer      string      // address that withdraws pool coin from the pool
    PoolCoin        sdk.Coin    // the amount of pool coin to withdraw
    WithdrawnCoins  sdk.Coin    // the amount of reserve coins for the amount of withdrawn pool coin
    Status          RequestStatus
}
```

## SwapRequestStatus
```go
type SwapRequestStatus int32

const (
    SwapRequestStatusUnspecified SwapRequestStatus = iota + 1
    SwapRequestStatusNotExecuted
    SwapRequestStatusNotMatched
    SwapRequestStatusPartiallyMatched
    SwapRequestStatusCompleted
    SwapRequestStatusCanceled
    SwapRequestStatusExpired
)
```

## SwapRequest
`SwapRequest` defines the state of swap message(`MsgLimitOrder`, `MsgMarketOrder`) as it is processed in the next batch or batches.

When a user sends `MsgLimitOrder` or `MsgMarketOrder` transaction to the network, it is accumulated in a batch.
`SwapRequest` contains the information required for swap transaction, the result and the status of the request.

```go
type SwapDirection int32

const (
    SwapDirectionUnspecified  SwapDirection = iota + 1
    SwapDirectionBuy
    SwalDirectionSell
)

type SwapRequest struct {
    Id                  uint64          // index of the swap message for the pair
    PairId              uint64          // index of the pair where the swap order is placed
    MsgHeight           int64           // block height where this message is appended to the batch
    Orderer             string          // address from which swap order was requested 
    Direction           SwapDirection
    OfferCoin           sdk.Coin        // amount of coin provided when requesting a swap
    RemainingOfferCoin  sdk.Coin        // remaining amount of offer coin after matching
    ReceivedCoin        sdk.Coin        // amount of received coin after matching
    Price               sdk.Dec         // order price of the swap message
    Amount              sdk.Int         // 
    OpenAmount          sdk.Int
    BatchId             uint64
    ExpireAt            time.Time
    Status              SwapRequestStatus
}
```


## CancelSwapRequest
```go
type CancelSwapRequest struct {
    Id              uint64
    PairId          uint64
    MsgHeight       int64
    Orderer         string
    SwapRequestId   uint64
    BatchId         uint64
    Status          RequestStatus
}
```
