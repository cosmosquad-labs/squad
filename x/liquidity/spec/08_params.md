| MinInitialDepositAmount | string (sdk.Int)    | "1000000"
| PairCreationFee         | string (sdk.Coins)  | [{"denom":"stake","amount":"1000000"}]
| PoolCreationFee         | string (sdk.Coins)  | [{"denom":"stake","amount":"1000000"}]

| WithdrawFeeRate         | string (sdk.Dec)    | "0.000000000000000000"
| MaxOrderLifespan        | time.Duration       | 24hours

## InitialPoolCoinSupply

Initial mint amount of pool coin on pool creation

## BatchSize

Block numbers for one batch. A BatchSize of 1 means that one batch consists of one block.

## TickPrecision

Because our DEX adopt tick system, we have to set tick precision which determine the gap between ticks. Default TickPrecision of 3 means that the price will be displayed from the highest digit to the last 3 digits.

## MinInitialDepositAmount

Minimum number of coins to be deposited to the liquidity pool upon pool creation.

## PairCreatinoFee

Fee paid for to create a pair. This fee prevents spamming and is collected in the community pool through fee collector

## PoolCreatinoFee

Fee paid for to create a pool. This fee prevents spamming and is collected in the community pool through fee collector

## FeeCollectorAddress

Account address for fee collecting module

## MaxPriceLimitRatio

MaxPriceLimitRatio defines the range of valid swap order price. Currently, the MaxPriceLimitRatio is 0.1 which means that the range of valid swap order price is (1-0.1)*lastPrice ~(1+0.1)*lastPrice of each pair. If a swap order with price outside that range is requested, the module will reject the order.

## SwapFeeRate 

Swap fee rate for swap. In this version, swap fees arenâ€™t paid upon swap orders directly. Instead, pool just adjust pool's quoting prices to reflect the swap fees.

## WithdrawFeeRate  

Reserve coin withdrawal with less proportion by WithdrawFeeRate. This fee prevents attack vectors from repeated deposit/withdraw transactions.

## MaxOrderLifespan  

Since our DEX allows partial execution of swap orders, we need a parameter for how long the remaining swap orders will remain on-chain. Leaving it for a long time needs lots of resources, the default is set to one day.
