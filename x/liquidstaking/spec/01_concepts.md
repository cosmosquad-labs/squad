## Liquid Staking Module

In this system, like normal staking, holders of the native staking token of the chain can become validators and can delegate tokens to validators, ultimately determining the effective validator set for the system. Otherwise, unlike normal staking, there exists the whitelist of validators who can receive delegation from liquid staking module and delegators have to agree that amount of their staking tokens will be distributed to that mentioned whitelisted active validators.

Delegators who stake their assets through liquid staking module will get bTokens (pegged staked representative tokens) which can used for additional utilities. When delegators want to unstake, the modoule will burn the bTokens and give them native tokens back.
